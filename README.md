# Eye Movement

## Description <BR>
Much like an eerily-painted portrait in a haunted house that watches your ever move, a challenge to creating eyes that follow a cursor.

## Usage<BR>
To challenge us to learn animated movement in JavaScript, or cry at the difficulty, or both.

## Roadmap<BR>
Understanding these concepts more and more is the goal. If I ever feel like making a webpage of a virtual creepy art gallery, I have one trick up my sleeve now.
